# GolfScoreResult 
A set of commandline programs that simulate a small golf score tracking and display processes for tournament
results. Use GolfScoreWriter.py to create a file containing the final score for a round of golf, saving it to 
a file and then displaying the results with GolfScoreDisplay.

# GolfScoreWriter.py
This program will accept user input for a golfer's name and their scores.
The data collected will be written as results to a text file to
be used by a seperate program.

# GolfScoreDisplay.py
This program reads golfer information from a file named 'results.txt'
and displays the information in a formatted page. Data is created using
a seperate program (GolfScoreWriter.py).
