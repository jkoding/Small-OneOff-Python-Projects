# CSV to SQL INSERT Commands Script
created with Python 3.10

# What does it do?
This program creates a SQL script containing INSERT commands using the data in a CSV file.
The CSV should have the data in a 'clean' state so the output is exactly what you need for
your insert commands. You do not have to use every column in the CSV, see the for loop in
the script for more information.

# How to Use
You can simply execute the script file with a csv file in the same directory to get
a sql file that contains INSERT commands to populate a table in SQL. Make sure
if not using the provided example data that you follow the commented instructions in the
script itself so you can modify it to meet your needs.
